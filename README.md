### What git command creates a branch?
  git checkout -b NAME_OF_BRANCH
### What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
  A fast forward merge occurs when the main branch you're merging to hasn't changed since being branched. A recursive merge occurs only when fast forwarding fails. 
### What git command changes to another branch?
  git checkout NAME_OF_BRANCH 
### What git command deletes a branch?
  git branch -D NAME_OF_BRANCH
### How do merge conflicts happen?
  They occur when Git cannot determine what to do regarding a file or folder, typically because it has been altered in differing ways on each branch.
